## <a name="overview" /> Overview

This tutorial will show how to set up a basic hapi server that displays "Hello World!" in your browser.

## <a name="installing" /> Installing hapi

Create a new directory `myproject`, and from there:

- Run: `cd myproject`, this goes into the created project folder.

- Run: `npm init` and follow the prompts.  This will generate a package.json file for you.

- Run: `npm install hapi`, this will install the latest version of hapi as a dependency in your package.json.

## <a name="server" /> Creating a Server

A very basic hapi server looks like the following:

```js
'use strict';

const Hapi = require('hapi');

const init = async () => {

    const server = Hapi.server({
        port: 3000,
        host: 'localhost'
    });

    await server.start();
    console.log('Server running on %ss', server.info.uri);
};

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {

    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
});

init();
```
First, we require hapi. Then we initialize a new `Hapi.server()` with connection details containing a port number to listen on and the host information. After that we start the server and log that it's running.

When creating a server, we can provide a hostname, IP address, a Unix socket file, or Windows named pipe to bind the server to. For more details, see the API reference.

The `host` property set to `localhost` is likely the safest choice. In a docker container, however, the localhost may not be accessible outside of the container and using `host: '0.0.0.0'` may be needed.

## <a name="routes" /> Adding Routes

After we get the server up and running, its time to add a route that will display "Hello World!" in our browser.

```js
'use strict';

const Hapi = require('hapi');

const init = async () => {

    const server = Hapi.server({
        port: 3000,
        host: 'localhost'
    });

    server.route({
        method: 'GET',
        path:'/',
        handler: (request, h) => {

       return 'Hello World!';
        }
    });

    await server.start();
    console.log('Server running on %ss', server.info.uri);
};

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {

    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
});

init();
```

Save the above as `index.js` and start the server with the command `node index.js`. Now you'll find that if you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you'll see the text 'Hello, World!'.

The `method` property can be any valid HTTP method, array of HTTP methods, or an asterisk to allow any method. 

The `path` property defines the path including parameters. It can contain optional parameters, numbered parameters, and even wildcards. For more details, see the routing tutorial.

The `handler` function performs the main business logic of the route and sets the response. The `handler` must return a value, a promise, or throw an error.

## <a name="everything" /> Everything Else

hapi has many, many other capabilities and only a select few are documented in tutorials here. Please use the list to your right to check them out. Everything else is documented in the [API reference](/api) and, as always, feel free to ask questions on [github](https://github.com/hapijs/discuss/issues) or just visit us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hapihour/shared_invite/enQtNTA5MDUzOTAzOTU4LTUyZmFiYjkyMTBmNDcyMmI2MmRjMzg4Y2YzNTlmNzUzNjViN2U1NmYyY2NjYjhiYWU4MGE2OTFhZDRlYWMyZDY).
